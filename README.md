# calender
Welcome to the Custom Calendar Application! This application is designed to provide a custom month view for managing events using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, implemented with Kotlin, Retrofit, Coroutines, and Hilt.

<h2>Features</h2>

Custom Month View: The application offers a visually appealing and interactive month view to display events and their corresponding dates.

Event Management: Users can easily add new events to specific dates, edit existing events, and remove events they no longer need.

MVVM Architecture: The application follows the MVVM architectural pattern, which enhances code organization, testability, and maintainability.

Kotlin: The project is written primarily in Kotlin, a modern programming language that offers concise and expressive syntax.

Retrofit: Retrofit is utilized for making network requests to fetch event data from a remote server or API.

Coroutines: Asynchronous programming is handled efficiently using Kotlin Coroutines, allowing smooth execution of tasks without blocking the main thread.

Hilt: Dependency injection is implemented with Hilt, which simplifies managing and providing dependencies throughout the application.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Once the application is up and running, you will be presented with the custom month view displaying the current month's events.

To add a new event, click on the desired date in the month view. A dialog box will appear, prompting you to enter event details such as title, time, and description.

To remove an event, click on the delete bin icon.
